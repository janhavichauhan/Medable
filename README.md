## 3. Security Fixes Implemented

### 3.1 Authentication System

**Modified Files:** `middleware/errorHandler.js`, `routes/auth.js`
**Issues Fixed:**

* Missing authentication for sensitive endpoints
* Insecure token handling
* No role-based access control

**Solution:**

* JWT authentication with 1-year expiry (testing)
* Role-based authorization (user/admin)
* Secure middleware for token validation
* Login endpoints with environment-based credentials

**Testing Example:**

```bash
# Login as user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"userpass123"}'

# Login as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"adminpass123"}'
```

---

### 2.2 File Upload Security

**Modified Files:** `middleware/fileValidation.js`, `routes/upload.js`
**Issues Fixed:**

* No file type or size validation
* Insecure filename handling
* No virus scanning
* Directory traversal vulnerability

**Solution:**

* MIME type validation and magic number checks
* File size limits (10MB general, 2MB for images)
* UUID-generated secure filenames
* Mock virus scanning simulation
* Strong file header validation

---

### 2.3 Access Control

**Modified Files:** `routes/upload.js`, `middleware/auth.js`
**Issues Fixed:**

* Users could access any files
* No ownership verification
* Admin routes unprotected

**Solution:**

* Enforced file ownership validation
* User isolation (users see only their files)
* Admin-only routes protected
* Role-based route access control

---

### 2.4 Input Validation and Sanitization

**Modified Files:** All route files
**Issues Fixed:**

* Lack of input sanitization
* Vulnerabilities to SQL injection, XSS, and path traversal

* Execute tests: authentication, upload, processing, archive, security

### 6.2 Using Terminal

```bash
# Run all tests (PowerShell)
.\run-all-tests.ps1

# Run all tests (Node.js)
node run-all-tests.js

# Example individual tests
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser","password":"userpass123"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/upload -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -F "file=@test-image.jpg"

curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/upload/FILE_ID/process -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"operation":"resize","width":200,"height":200}'
```

## 7. Environment Setup

**.env file:**

```
PORT=8888
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
